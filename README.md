# ML-science kit
## Simple Data Science and Machine Learning toolkit
Personal revamped version of KelosBot classifier's libraries</br>
Original code stored in https://github.com/janrocketman/KelosBot/tree/classifier</br>
There is only code written by repo's owner</br>
### What it could be..?
Here you will find out scripts for:
* Make VK dataset
* Perform EDA with csv datasets with cleaning texts
* Train Keras model, which we`ve used in KeLoss project and save it
* Classificate natural-language texts
* Estimate the semantic similarity of pairs of texts
#### Something about parameters..?
Yeah, it could be interesting. Python Classes stored in these files uses very much parameters.</br>
The library is well documented.
More details about its use can be learned using the "help" method for each class.
### Prerequireties
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* pymorphy2 with pymorphy2-dicts-ru/uk
* nltk with basic dictionaries and stop-words
* numpy
* pandas
* Sklearn
#### If you want to use our dataset
* vk_api
</br>
#### * Then tou could make dataset, possibly with our scripts, stored in this branch
#### * Now you can train your own model
#### * And after all, PREDICT THEM ALL!!!
